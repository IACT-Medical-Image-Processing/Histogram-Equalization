# Image-Histogram-Equalizaion

This repository is for implementation of Histogram Equalization for its application in the field of Machine Learning, AI, NeuralNets etc.! 
See my repository's 'Wiki' Page (see below my repository name to find 'Wiki' column)  to see my results.

We often come across images whose contrast is not good enough for visualizing or using in Machine Learning classification tasks. So to enhance brightness/contrast I have used the technique called Global Histogram Equalization.
